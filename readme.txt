Project Description: 
A program that generates a Sudoku puzzle that can be played by users. As users input numbers in the boxes, they will receive feedback indicating whether their guess was correct or not. If incorrect, it will give the user another chance to guess. Each time the game is run, it will produce a new board to play. 

Functions: 
A function that uses Tkinter to create the Sudoku game board visual. 
A function that allows users to input their guesses, and checks if the number will correctly fit in the specified box. 
A function that figures out if the board is complete and displays “complete!” on the screen if it is.
